# ðŸš€ **Unleashing Horsepower**
### *Exploring the Dynamic Interplay Between Car Specifications Across Distinct Automotive Clusters*

---

## ðŸ“‹ **Project Overview**
This project analyzes the relationship between **horsepower** and various car specifications. By leveraging **machine learning** and **clustering techniques**, the analysis identifies:
1. Key predictors of horsepower.
2. Distinct automotive clusters based on shared characteristics.

The goal is to provide **targeted insights** that link performance metrics with design attributes, enabling better understanding and predictions of a car's power output.

For a deep dive into the methodology, results, and insights, please refer to the full **documentation** provided in the repository.
